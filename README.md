# T20 Cricket Player Selection Project

## Overview

This project aims to select the best T20 cricket players using data analytics. By leveraging Python, Pandas, and Power BI, we can analyze player performance data to make informed decisions for team selection.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to create a robust data analytics pipeline to evaluate T20 cricket players based on their performance metrics. This involves:

- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and manipulating the data using Python and Pandas.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Power BI to create interactive visualizations for better insights.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available cricket statistics websites and datasets.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data processing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Cleaning the data to handle missing values and outliers.
   - Using Pandas to filter, group, and aggregate player statistics.
   - Creating new metrics to evaluate players' performance.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Importing the processed data into Power BI.
   - Creating interactive dashboards to visualize player performance metrics.
   - Using visualizations to make data-driven decisions for player selection.

## Results

The final output includes a set of interactive dashboards in Power BI that allow users to:
- Compare player performances based on various metrics.
- Filter players based on specific criteria (e.g., batting average, strike rate, bowling economy).
- Make informed decisions for selecting the best T20 players.
